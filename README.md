# Slack Channel FOMO Bot

> Get notified when a new channel is created in Slack.

We love [Slack](https://slack.com) here at [Segment](https://segment.com/). We use it for [_everything_](http://blog.andyjiang.com/ladder-redefining-ping-pong-at-segment/) and have over 150 different channels.

I have pretty acute Slack FOMOâ€”what if I miss some tidbit of info in some channel that could help me with my job or inspire me for a new project? So I made this Slack Channel FOMO bot to ping `#feed-new-channel` whenever a new channel is created.

## Install

<a href="https://slack.com/oauth/authorize?scope=bot&client_id=4292025120.18677052932"><img alt="Add to Slack" height="40" width="139" src="https://platform.slack-edge.com/img/add_to_slack.png" srcset="https://platform.slack-edge.com/img/add_to_slack.png 1x, https://platform.slack-edge.com/img/add_to_slack@2x.png 2x"></a>

## Setup

When you install the bot, it'll ask you what channel you want it to publish new channels. At Segment, we have a channel dedicated to new channels: `#feed-new-channel`. Up to you :).
